# Live Ops Showcase

This repository is a public-facing demonstration of the live operations workflows and tools used in the development of *Myths Reborn: Origins*, an indie action game created by Wyatt Price under WorthyPath Games.

The goal is to simulate a real studio Live Ops environment through:
- Clear content update planning
- Player feedback integration
- Bug tracking and changelog transparency
- Lightweight internal tools and trackers

## ðŸ§° Whatâ€™s Inside

- `/notion-tracker/` â€“ Visual calendar + issue tracker (linked or embedded)
- `/scripts/` â€“ Sample tools (e.g. changelog automation, version tracking)
- `/changelogs/` â€“ Markdown logs for dev update history
- `/templates/` - Markdown files of templates frequently used
- `GitHub Projects` â€“ Simulated bug triage board (WIP)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Provide signal to employers and collaborators regarding Live Ops proficiency
- Show initiative in live game content planning and operational workflows
- Create an ongoing portfolio of practical tools and documentation
