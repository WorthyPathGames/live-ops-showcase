# Myths Reborn: Origins â€“ Dev Update 001  
ðŸ“… April 20, 2025 

### âœ¨ New Feature  
- Implemented **god ability selection feedback system**.  
  - When choosing a god's ability, the player character now flickers with a color representative of that god (e.g., blue for Poseidon, red for Ares).  
  - This serves as a visual confirmation and adds flavor/personality to the transformation system.

### ðŸ“Œ Notes  
- This lays the groundwork for future transformation logic and passive/active ability integration.  
- Additional polish (timing, audio, VFX) planned for future updates.
